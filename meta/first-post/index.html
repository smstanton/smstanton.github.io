<h1 id="hello">Hello</h1>

<p>Hello, I&rsquo;m Stephen.  Welcome to NoSlackDev.</p>

<p>This first post is also represented in the About section.</p>

<p>The idea behind this blog is still forming, but instead of trying to have a fully fleshed out idea before starting it, I thought it wise to just start&hellip; and see where it goes.</p>

<p>This is a blog about learning and improving in general, with a particular focus around software development.  I seek to guide myself through a growing curriculum of classes, books, projects, and other activities to improve myself in many ways: as a technologist, a developer, a problem solver, a thinker, a builder, a consultant, and in a variety of other skills and interests that I may write about here.  Learning should never end, so this journey will be one that doesn&rsquo;t end - but it should have many points of interest along the way, and you are welcome to join me in visiting them if you are on a similar journey.</p>

<p>I start out as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-stanton-17667924/">technology professional</a> with a passing understanding of many technologies.  I&rsquo;ve tinkered with technology from the time I was young, took a lot of classes, read a lot of books, earned a few certifications, and contributed to many projects.  I know enough to get by, pretty well in some cases.  Yet I, like many, aspire to improve.</p>

<h2 id="curriculum">Curriculum</h2>

<p>I have a curriculum that I will follow, which was constructed using the <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science">OSSU Computer Science</a> education as a starting point.  I&rsquo;ve added many other objectives to the curriculum according to my interests and personal learning style, and I will continually refine this curriculum over time.  At some point, I may publish the entire backlog of curriculum if there is interest.  For now, I will publish those things that I am actively working on, along with a preview of what I think is coming up next.</p>

<p>I am a completist by nature.  When I learn something, I have to go deep.  I can barely watch a movie without digging into all the facts I can find about it.  I&rsquo;m bringing this mentality to my approach here, and am starting at the beginning on many of the topics I pursue.  I will be relearning many things that I&rsquo;ve learned in the past, but I&rsquo;m taking a more thorough approach this time through, and publishing my writing, source, and useful notes as I go.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-follow-along">How to follow along</h2>

<p>The curriculum is divided into objectives, which are individual efforts such as finishing a course, reading a book, finishing a project, or earning a certificate.  Objectives don&rsquo;t have a defined timeline: some will be short-term, others long.  Each objective will have its own category.</p>

<p>Objectives where there is a development component will have a corresponding repository on <a href="https://github.com/smstanton">my GitHub site</a>, where I will keep my source updated as I go.</p>

<p>There will be some categories that don&rsquo;t map directly to an objective.  At some point down the road, I will organize the Categories page to make this distinction more apparent.</p>

<p>Posts will be tagged to callout details of the posts that will help with search-ability over time.</p>

<p>Over time, I will support this structure with better formatting across the site, which depends on my learning Hugo (the static site generator I&rsquo;m using to produce this site) - which is a good example of an objective.  For now, I will post objectives at the end of this page.</p>

<p>Finally, you can follow me on Twitter @NoSlackDev.</p>
