      <description>I finished Week 1 the week before last. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of a struggle as I&amp;rsquo;ve been through this week before. I finished the Hello, Mario (More), and Credit in pretty quick succession.
The Credit assignment was fun because it has some overlap in what I do in my day job. We work closely with payment gateways and credit card processing on some of our projects, so I ended up in familiar territory with this assignment.</description>

      <description>While on the road for work last week, I watched the Week 0 lecture and completed the problem set. This was probably the 3rd or 4th time I&amp;rsquo;ve watched this lecture, since I&amp;rsquo;ve started and not completed CS50 several times. CS50 re-records the lecture each year for the live class at Harvard, and online students like myself get the benefit of updated materials. The content is pretty consistent from year to year, but the execution continues to improve (impressive, considering how good it is to begin with).</description>

      <description>The journey begins with CS50.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started this course a few times over the years, and only made it through the first two or three problem sets before my attention moved elsewhere. The experience I have had with it so far has been very positive. The content is very well produced and is refreshed often if I remember correctly. The instructor, David Malan, is very engaging and a pleasure to learn from.</description>
