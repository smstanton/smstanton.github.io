      <p>I finished Week 1 the week before last.  It wasn&rsquo;t much of a struggle as I&rsquo;ve
been through this week before.  I finished the Hello, Mario (More), and Credit
in pretty quick succession.</p>

<p>The Credit assignment was fun because it has some overlap in what I do in my day
job.  We work closely with payment gateways and credit card processing on some
of our projects, so I ended up in familiar territory with this assignment.</p>

<p>I am most of the way through Week 2 at the moment.  I completed Caesar and
Vigenere earlier this week, and am part way through Crack.  I will do a full
post on Week 2 when I wrap it up.</p>
