      <p>The journey begins with CS50.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started this course a few times over the
years, and only made it through the first two or three problem sets before my
attention moved elsewhere.  The experience I have had with it so far has been
very positive.  The content is very well produced and is refreshed often if I
remember correctly.  The
instructor, David Malan, is very engaging and a pleasure to learn from. The
community and energy around this class is outstanding - likely because CS50 is
often a starting point for people in technology.  I&rsquo;m excited to start this
course - one last time - and see it through to the end.</p>

<p>Even though I&rsquo;ve started this course a few times in the past, I plan on starting
from the beginning once again, and not re-using any of my previous work.  I
haven&rsquo;t cracked open the syllabus just yet, so I&rsquo;m not certain at the moment
about what I can or should post on a public GitHub repository.  I will likely
only post assignments that are of my creation, and not any standard assignment
answers.  I will confirm this soon.</p>
