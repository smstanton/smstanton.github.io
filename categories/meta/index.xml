      <description>Hello Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Stephen. Welcome to NoSlackDev.
This first post is also represented in the About section.
The idea behind this blog is still forming, but instead of trying to have a fully fleshed out idea before starting it, I thought it wise to just start&amp;hellip; and see where it goes.
This is a blog about learning and improving in general, with a particular focus around software development. I seek to guide myself through a growing curriculum of classes, books, projects, and other activities to improve myself in many ways: as a technologist, a developer, a problem solver, a thinker, a builder, a consultant, and in a variety of other skills and interests that I may write about here.</description>
